    longDescription: 'SLIDES was born as my dream program. As a language learner I always wished I could improve my learning and cut down memorization through a good visual system I can use to review and learn new vocabulary without friction. I was looking for a good way to do that for a while, but I could not find somthing that would quite meet my standards. That was when I decided to take it on myself. Tackling this project was incredibly time consuming. The main issue was finding suitable assets that maintained a consistent aesthetic and quality. I had to set some constraints to define what would be a valuable asset and what not and scan through thousands of photos manually to select the right ones. SLIDES is a visual way to learn through observation, memorization and discussion. As time went on, the project became unsustainable due to the lack of readily available quality assets what can clearly define abstract concepts visually. But AI has changed that, breathing new life into the project. With new advanced AI tools, the SLIDES suite of desings will be transformed into a more comprehensive library, a visual dictionary with a design and aesthetics-first approach and possible an AI-powered app, capable of handling all the different assets in an intelligent and more efficient way. New capabilities will be added to SLIDES, including flashcard spaced-repetition, user-input interactivity, more video content, and a more polished, automated image curation process and AI generation for highly abstract concepts. A first prototype for new AI powered slides has already been produced with extraordinary results.',

    description: 'A logo that reflects my eclectic personality and personality.',
    longDescription: "The logo began as an initial, B, multiplied by six to reflect the six classical arts. All of the Bs sit inside a thick black frame. I first tried building the letter from scratch using simple shapes, but it looked too hidden, too subtle to get and too meaningless. So I found a font with bold, angular lines that felt modern and sharp without trying too hard. The box around the Bs started as a nod to the idea of thinking outside the box. But over time, it became more of a frame. The box is a space to explore and to hold ideas in place. I thought about adding a bright line cutting through it, leaving the constraints and becoming free. But the design felt cluttered, so I removed it. The blue gradient came later. I tested several palettes before landing on this one — fresh, clean, and quietly expressive. Blue has range. Once a rare and costly dye, now lab-made and accessible. It bridges the past and the present, just like I try to do by looking forward with great respect for what came before. The signature over the Bs adds something personal. It doesn’t need to be legible. It’s there to ground the design and give it presence and identity. It was a must. This logo lives in a small corner of my site, and I may not use it for anything else. Perhaps if I ever start a YouTube channel I may use it. Still, it holds a lot and embodies many of my core values. I ended up falling in love with it.",

    description: "Cover art for my band's first single.",
    longDescription: "The release of my first song on Spotify was an exciting project. Worked on our album repertoire for months, but wanted to start slow and drive some listeners into our Spotify by releasing a few singles before that. The first one was 'Gente Como Tú', a song about self-acceptance that celebrates being different, even when it means being odd. The cover art was conceived first as a digital design. But I felt like something was missing. Inspired by the work of David Carson, I decided to turn it into a collage project to add volume and depth. I printed the desing on multiple layers and printed it in 4 different kinds of paper. All the different layers were cut out and organically aged and misaligned to reclaim their individuality. Every single cut-out became a symbol of the songs message. All unique, all broken, all damaged. And yet all contributing to the whole. The patterns in the design were created by combining Ts and Us, and shaping them into multiple crosses or plus signs. At the center of the design, there's an accent. The idea was to integrate the Spanish word 'TÚ' ('you') and the plus sign '+' to express the idea in the song's main line 'Hace falta más gente como tú' ('The world needs more people like you'), in a visual and abstract way. The design was meant to stand as a bit of a challenge and a puzzle for those with a keen eye.",

    description: "A speed-reading and accessibility reading app to improve reading speed and concentration",
    longDescription: "I made this app to make reading on screens feel better, faster, clearer, and more focused. Every day, I spend long hours in front of a screen, and actually sitting down to read something in full can feel draining and daunting. I wanted a tool that kept me engaged without cutting corners. The goal wasn’t to skim or summarize. I still want to be able to read everything, just more efficiently. There're plenty of text-to-speech options out there already. But they can be highly expensive if you're looking for a good result. Audiobooks are also great, but reading with your own inner voice brings something different. I wanted to keep that experience while making it smoother and less tiring. Most of us read on our phones now, but long blocks of text and endless scrolling make it harder to stay focused. So, I built a simple system: break up the text into short, readable chunks and lay them out each on its own page. It's like turning pages in a book, but designed for mobile, slides, or video, which still has not established a universal solution. That feature alone changed everything and I believe it holds the most potential. You can also adjust the speed, contrast, and layout. It works well for everyone and it's especially helpful for neurodivergent readers and people with dyslexia. The whole idea is to make reading easier, without losing what makes it meaningful. The app also supports multiple tabs so you can pace your reading and keep track of where you left it the last time you were reading.",

    description: "A chatbot that thinks like a human",
    longDescription: "Emma is my last and most sophisticated GPT conversational chatbot. But she isn't just a chatbot that acts friendly. She's what we may call an AH, rather than an AI. The main advantage of AI is also it's greatest flaw. Artificial Intelligence is too wide in its scope or too smart for their own good. This is also precisely what makes it feel impersonal, cold, and robotic. Models like ChatGPT are not capable of holding a 'normal' conversation. It needs to have a context, a set of heuristics and constraints. We take that for granted because for us, that's just life. But AIs cannot have a personality unless we give them one. That got me thinking and I built Emma together with some other GPTs to have a personality that, much like that of humans', would be shaped by experiences. Emma doesn't only have a personality. She has a life, a history, a job, a family and even a present. Emma was built to be modular, replicable and independent. She doesn't act based on requests, she acts based on interest, interaction and instinct. Emma has constraints and doesn't know everything. I've also worked on giving Emma a voice that would reflect her sociocultural background and personality. With this custom AI voice, Emma can speak and behave very close to the way humans behave and interact with other. Emma has a lot of room for growth, but the sky is the limit. As of now, lighter models need to be used for certain applications, but the most powerful models will soon become more affordable and widely available. This means that even without making any changes to Emma, she will get smarter and smarter, and more human-like over time. In no-time AH models will become more and more popular and necessary. They will compete with generalist AIs and outperform them in ways that cannot be simply mimicked or faked. Diversity will always outperform one-size-fits-all solutions. And it will be agents that feel more like Emma that will really transform the world more profoundly thanks to a more human approach and much better alignment.",

    longDescription: "VISE is a deeply personal passion project. It stems from an idea that lived in my mind for years before coming to life. Early concept simulations in Premiere hinted at the vision, but the reality has grown into something far more sophisticated. At its core, VISE is a modular soft AI system powered by an emergent algorithm and a network of heuristics designed to replicate human behavior. It supports four modes: photo, video, YouTube, and camera. Its capabilities include identifying and scanning key human features. Though still in development, VISE already handles motion tracking and uses an internal heatmap memory system to revisit visually engaging subjects. Currently, I am working on an eye-tracking feature that mirrors user gaze patterns to emulate socially attentive visual behavior. A step toward truly interactive vision intelligence.",

    description: 'An Infinite Tesseract of Knowledge',
    longDescription: "I was tired of having to prompt bots every time I wanted to learn about something. I was tired of algorithms feeding me what they thought I deserved to learn. So, I decided to make a bot that felt more intuitive, manageable and that I could use consistently without starting from scratch every time. I had been exploring concept icebergs for a while. The iceberg is an internet phenomenon that emerged as a quick guide into the depths of different fields of expertise. I thought that should become an app. Iceberg is a library of books divided into 210 pages called 'tiers'. Each tier can be explored in different ways. You can read an essay which is long enough for a 10-minute read, or you can chat with the bot about the target contents of that tier. This makes knowledge feel navigable again. It's like a book, but it's also like Wikipedia. But it's more than that. It's like a key to the depths of the insights contained deep within the vast neural networks of AI models. Iceberg is a way to find your way through the neural network, one page at a time. But it doesn't end there. I was inspired by the Library of Babel, an infinite online library, and the concept of recursive infinity and fractals. I made Iceberg infinitely expandable. Every tier can be fractured into another 210 tiers, meaning we can get more granular about our learning as well as explore endlessly if we want. So Iceberg is truly limitless but not in an overwhelming way. In the app, I wanted to keep some of the classic iceberg chart aesthetics, so I went for an ice blue to black gradient for the background. The background is dynamic and becomes darker and darker the deeper you descend into the abyss. I also liked the eerie feel of the Library of Babel, so I decided to give my app a mysterious alien language to emulate and signal the idea that this is hidden knowledge, handed to us from something superhuman.",

    description: 'An indie-rock band conceived to evoke beauty, wanderlust and nostalgia',
    longDescription: "When I started listining to more Spanish rock and indie bands, I decided to challenge myself to write songs again, but this time in Spanish. I couldn't believe how quickly I was writing new songs. I developed a new method to write lyrics that became my secret weapon. Soon, I was writing multiple songs a week, sometimes I would write more than one song per day. I quickly wrote enough songs to record an album, so I formed the band 'La Alfombra Mágica' and we worked on the arrangements together. Just a few months later we were ready to perform live. And that's exactly what we did. It was a great feeling to jump onto a stage again. We recorded our single 'Gente Como Tú' in just about a day. The quality and style our producer delivered was not what I had in mind. We asked them to tweak and adjust some aspects of the mix but the final result was still not convincing in the least. I ended up mixing and mastering the song myself. I had a really tight schedule and had to spend hours mixing after work, but we managed to release the song a few days later. The band started gaining momentum and we soon were being hired for local rock and indie festivals. We had a blast until we finally parted ways. We didn't have enough time to release our next single but we were already working on the production of three songs. Maybe one day I'll solo the project or start a new band to record the songs. Over the time the band was active, I ended up writing 80+ songs for the project.",

    longDescription: "My friend had come to my place to jam. We had a productive session and she was about to leave. Then she casually mmentioned she needed to write a song for her capstone project and that she needed some help. She had a melody in mind. She hummed it to me and I couldn't help but play it on my keyboard. Long story short, she told me the concept they had in mind for the song and it resonated with much of my personal philosophy and experience. She left and by the next morning I sent her a recorning of the song with practically finalized lyrics and chords. It felt like a powerful anthem. For the following months we worked on it together. I knew I wanted to express authenticity and eclecticism to highlight the message of individuality the song preaches. So I thought of having the song evolve seemlessly through different genres. This became a massive endeavor I didn't anticipate. The song starts with a full orchestra cinematic intro with complex arrangements and transitions from jazz to electronic, to gospel, metal, latin, back to orchestral...It was hard to write, record and, more than anything, it was a nightmare to mix. But I did it anyway because I believed in the project. The song ended up having hundreds of layered tracks, handling multiple VSTis and real insturments, along with hundreds of layers of voices. The result was glorious and the capstone project got an A. The project included a music video with dancers performing a group choreography and a making of. I was mainly focused in the songwriting, musical arrangement, audio engineering, mixing, recording and singing. It took months to complete but I felt incredibly proud once it was finished.",
