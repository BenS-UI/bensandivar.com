          <div class="about-bio">
            <p>I’ve spent the past decade shaping ideas into audiovisual experiences across mediums. From branding systems to interactive tools, my work blends aesthetics and utility with thoughtful simplicity and artistic value.</p>
            <p>Beyond professional work, I’m driven by curiosity. I explore linguistics, learning techniques, psychology, cognitive frameworks, and the intersection of philosophy, art, and technology to discover new points of synthesis and smarter ways to design.</p>
            <p>I’m a futurist and like to stay posted on the latest updates in science, society, and politics. I believe in looking forward, but am a lover of antiquity, and I greatly respect and learn from tradition.</p>
